## Introduction
- Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.

## Objective
This is a command-line calculator, written in C, supporting the standard mathematical operations and a set of functions. Commands can be entered in standard infix syntax, with parentheses denoting nonstandard order of operations.Like we were taught in elementary and middle school.
## Operators
+ Addition
